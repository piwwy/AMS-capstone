# Instructions for Refactoring server.js (FMS → AMS)

Goal:
Refactor server.js from Financial Management System (FMS) into Alumni Management System (AMS).

1. Keep core setup:
   - Keep express, cors, dotenv, middleware, trust proxy, health check, error handling, and graceful shutdown.

2. Remove all FMS-specific routes:
   - /api/budget
   - /api/revenue
   - /api/expenses
   - /api/payables
   - /api/receivables
   - /api/funds
   - /api/procurement
   - /api/assets
   - /api/reports

3. Replace with AMS-specific routes:
   - /api/auth → Authentication & registration
   - /api/alumni → Alumni records (profiles, directory, requests)
   - /api/tracking → Graduate career tracking (employment status, cohorts, outcomes)
   - /api/jobs → Job board, job posts, placement logs, recommendations
   - /api/events → Events (calendar, create, attendance)
   - /api/donations → Donations (donor preferences, approvals)
   - /api/campaigns → Fundraising campaigns
   - /api/communications → Announcements, newsletters, mailing lists
   - /api/surveys → Surveys, responses, insights
   - /api/reports → Alumni reports, analytics, exports
   - /api/achievements → Alumni achievements
   - /api/mentorship → Mentorship program (mentor/mentee pairing)
   - /api/users → User management (RBAC, roles, permissions)
   - /api/audit-logs → Audit logs & system activity
   - /api/settings → System configs, email templates, integrations

4. Health Check:
   - Keep `/api/health` endpoint
   - Update response to show `"system": "Alumni Management System"`

5. Console Logs:
   - Update startup message to:
     🚀 Alumni Management System API running on port X
     📊 Environment: ...
     🔗 Health check: http://localhost:X/api/health

6. Error handling:
   - Keep global error handler and 404 handler
   - No changes needed except error messages should mention AMS, not FMS


“Here’s server.js and an instructions.txt. Please refactor server.js into AMS version by removing FMS-specific routes and adding AMS modules. Keep health check, error handling, and graceful shutdown. Update console logs to say Alumni Management System API.”
