Instructions for Refactoring App.tsx (FMS → AMS)

Convert this App.tsx from Financial Management System (FMS) into Alumni Management System (AMS).

Keep login.tsx (AlumniLogin.tsx) as is. Do not modify it.

Remove all routes related to the old FMS modules, including:

StudentBilling

ExpenseRequests

PurchaseOrders

Disbursements

BankReconciliation

BudgetForecasting

BudgetTracking

Add routes for the following AMS components (all located under components/ams/):

Ensure routing works with React Router v6 (use Routes, Route, and element={} syntax).

Clean up App.tsx so there are no unused imports and it is easy to expand later.
